# Document-Repository
Website developed using the ASP.NET MVC framework connected to an Oracle 12c Database.

Web application for storing and distributing ﬁles and folders, similar to Google Drive. 
The clients are able to create and access personal accounts, and they can create groups in which content is shared with other users. 
The algorithms I developed parse the content of the following ﬁle types: .txt .pdf .docx .xlsx .pptx .html. 
This allows the user to search his entire folder by the content of the ﬁles. This is done using Query Relaxation.

Front-end: HTML, CSS.

Back-end: C#, ASP.NET Razor

Database: Oracle 12c Database
